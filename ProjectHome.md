You start as a meager vampire recently bitten, and your thirst for blood is immense.  You must find and suck the blood out of as many humans as you possibly can, and if you find any other vampires on the way, attempt to drain them as well.  By sucking the blood out of more humans, you gain skill to spend in areas which you desire, which can help you out in attack and defense against other vampires.
